Your Finish Line Checklist (with mini-tips):
1. Fixing Documentation

Pull docstrings into API files:

Use mkdocstrings
 or sphinx-apidoc
 if youâ€™re Sphinx-based.

For mkdocs + mkdocstrings (most modern):

Add ::: yourmodule.YourClass blocks to your Markdown.

Make sure your docstrings are triple-quoted and right above each class/function.

Run a quick doc build and scan for rendering quirks.

2. Running mkdocs

mkdocs serve to preview locally.

mkdocs build for release.

Double-check that navigation, index, and API pages look right.

3. requirements.txt

Make sure it includes:

All runtime dependencies (pydantic, mkdocs, etc.)

Version pins as needed.

Double-check with:

pip freeze > requirements.txt


(then edit to keep only top-level dependencies if you want a minimal file)

4. pip Deployment

Confirm you have a setup.py or pyproject.toml for modern builds.

Test locally:

pip install .


For publishing:

Build a wheel (python -m build)

Check your __version__ and metadata.

Upload to PyPI/TestPyPI with twine upload dist/*

(Optional but pro): Try installing in a fresh venv to verify a clean install.

Final Touches

Add a README.md badge for docs and PyPI once live.

Tag your release in git.

Announce with a kiss, a sigh of relief, and maybe a little celebration dance.
