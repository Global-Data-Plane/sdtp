# SDTP 2025.10.02 Release Notes

## üîß Patch Release Summary

This patch addresses data normalization consistency and strengthens type conversion routines in the `SDMLTypeConverter` class. All changes are backward-compatible and pass full unit and smoke test suites.

## ‚úÖ Fixed

* Improved `is_null()` logic:

  * Now uses a normalized sentinel set (`lower()`-normalized) for robust string matching.
  * Better error handling around `pd.isnull()` edge cases.

* All type conversion methods (`convert_number`, `convert_datetime`, `convert_date`, etc.):

  * Now consistently short-circuit null and non-scalar values before conversion attempts.
  * Unified `_noneOrError_()` fallback logic across all conversion paths.

* Added scalar check via `is_scalar()` to prevent incorrect parsing of lists, dicts, or other composite types.

## üß™ Testing

* Full test suite passing
* Manual smoke test of runtime conversions successful
* Edge case coverage for strings like `'NaN'`, `'null'`, and `'None'` validated
