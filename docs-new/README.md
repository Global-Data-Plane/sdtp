# Simple Data Transfer Protocol (SDTP)

Welcome to SDTP — a protocol and toolkit for moving, sharing, and working with tabular data simply, honestly, and with zero vendor magic. If you’ve ever thought “Data sucks, and it’s not your fault,” you’re in the right place.

## What is SDTP?

SDTP is an open, practical standard for sharing and transforming tabular data across systems, tools, and organizations — using honest, human-readable markup (SDML), simple query language (SDQL), and a clean, explicit API.  
It’s built for people who want data to be a solved problem, not a permanent pain.

### At a Glance

- **SDML:** JSON-based Simple Data Markup Language for describing tables.
- **SDQL:** Simple Data Query Language for filtering and selecting data.
- **SDTP Server:** A REST server implementing the SDTP API for exposing, loading, and querying tables.

➕  
**Key Features**

- **Simplicity:** Designed for clarity and ease of use—edit by hand, read by eye.
- **Remote Queries:** Query any SDTP server over HTTP with plain REST calls.
- **Easy Conversion:** Move data to and from JSON, CSV, XLS/XLSX, and SQL databases.
- **Infinite Data Streams:** Support for both static and streaming/tabular data.
- **Composability:** Build, filter, and combine data and queries with a text editor.
- **Extensibility:** Add new operators, types, or backends as your needs grow.
- **Transparency:** Inspect and understand every data flow—no hidden magic.

## Why SDTP?

- To make tables and datasets as portable as text files.
- To break down the walls between platforms, clouds, and file formats.
- To empower you with *honest, inspectable* data flows — nothing hidden, nothing “magic.”
